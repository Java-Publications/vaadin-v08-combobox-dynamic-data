# Vaadin Combobox with dynamic data
In this example we are working with the Combobox itself.
So far we have the Vaadin V8 version.
The target will be to deal with a data set that is far to big to hold it inside the session itself.

Different versions of Vaadin will provide different version of how to deal with this issue.
If you have V7 code and you want to migrate to V8 or V10, you need to know how to change 
the basic structure.

## Nano Vaadin Meecrowave
To start the Servletcontainer I am using the approach from the Nano Vaadin Meecrowave Example.
This example you can find here: [https://github.com/Nano-Vaadin-Demos/nano-vaadin-meecrowave](https://github.com/Nano-Vaadin-Demos/nano-vaadin-meecrowave)

With this you can create a fat - jar, perfect for Micro-UIs packed in a docker image.

Meecrowave from Apache you can find here:
